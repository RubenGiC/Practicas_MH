# Metaheuristic
# Practice 1
**I have learned how to solve problems with metaheuristics**

I solved the problem of grouping with restrictions, using Greedy and Simple Trayectory Search. 

**With Greedy**

This algorithm is any algorithm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the local optimal choice at each stage, 
it isn't the globaly optimal solution, but it's an approximate a globally optimal solution.

In the problem of grouping with restrictions, I have adapted the orginal Greedy algorithm.

***Peseudo code***

* **X:** dataset
* **R:** restriction set
* **k:** constant number of cluster

``` 
Greedy(X, R, k, centroides){
  created the vector of idexes of the dataset (RSI)
  //shuffle the vector indexes
  RSI.random.shuffle();
      
  do{
    for(i in RSI){
    }
  }while(change C);
}
```
